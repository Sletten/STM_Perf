communication protocol for PERF module, based on MIP data communications protocol.


Packet overciew

	Header

-Start of Packet (SOP)
One or two bytes of bit sequence, (characters) to innitiate the start of a packet

-Data type byte
One byte which value decides what type of data is sendt in the Payload
followed by one byte describes the category of the data type.
Preset table of available values to be used for pre determined data type.
one value might indicate that the payload includes several data types.

-Payload Length byte
One byte which value indicates how many bytes is contained in the Payload.



	Payload

-Payload header
applicable if data type indicates several types of data is sendt.
Data type byte, same as above.
Data length, the length of this payload chunk

-Payload data
The data sendt as payload, length described by previous byte.


	Checksum
one or two bytes for checksum, might use 16-bit fletch checksum as described in the MIP reference
