communication protocol for PERF module, based on MIP data communications protocol.


Packet overciew

	Header

-Start of Packet (SOP)
One or two bytes of bit sequence, (characters) to innitiate the start of a packet
Startbyte 1: 155
Startbyte 2: 185


-Data type byte
Two bytes describing what type of data is being sendt.
First one byte describing command type
- COMMAND		Genreal system commands, retrieving info, performing system test, and such
- CONTROL		Controlling systems, like thruster, manip, light
- SENSOR		Retrieving data from sensor
- SYSTEM PARAMETER	Setting and reading system parameters stored in eeprom

Then one byte to describe what system to connect with.

- Thruster
- Manipulator
- Light
- Camera


-Payload Length byte
One byte which value indicates how many bytes is contained in the Payload.
Counting onlye the number of data bytes sendt, not to include the start header(startbytes, datatype, and length), or the checksum bytes



	Payload

-Payload header
applicable if data type indicates several types of data is sendt.
Data type byte, same as above.
Data length, the length of this payload chunk

-Payload data
The data sendt as payload, length described by previous byte.


	Checksum
Two bytes for checksum, might use 16-bit fletch checksum as described in the MIP reference




Table of data types:

		channel number, 1 byte - 8 possible active, (eg: 00101101, ch 1, 3, 4, 6 active)
		set actuator type (motor/servo/stepper) // is this usefull? PERF firmware controls manip fuctionalyty anyways.
		set enpoints
		set max speed/power/
		set midpoint
		set
